**DAE Tools** is a cross-platform equation-based object-oriented modelling, simulation and optimisation software.
It is initially developed for simulation of processes in chemical process industry
(mass, heat and momentum transfers, chemical reactions, separation processes, thermodynamics).
Today, **DAE Tools** is multi-domain.
**DAE Tools**  is released under the `GNU General Public Licence <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL>`_
and runs on all major operating systems (Windows, GNU Linux and Mac OS) and architectures (x86, x86_64, arm).

Broadly speaking, it is not a modelling language nor an integrated software suite of data structures and routines
for scientific applications, but rather a higher level structure – an architectural design of interdependent
software components providing an API for:

* Model specification
* Activities on developed models (simulation, optimisation, parameter estimation)
* Processing of the results, such as plotting and exporting to various file formats
* Report generation
* Code generation, co-simulation and model exchange

Class of problems that can be solved by **DAE Tools**:

* Initial value problems of implicit form, described by a system of linear, non-linear, and (partial-)differential
  algebraic equations
* Index-1 DAE systems
* With lumped or distributed parameters: Finite Difference or Finite Elements Methods (still experimental)
* Steady-state or dynamic
* Continuous with some elements of event-driven systems (discontinuous equations, state transition networks
  and discrete events)

**DAE Tools** apply a hybrid approach between modelling and general purpose programming languages, combining
the strengths of both approaches into a single one. The most important features of the hybrid approach are:

1. Support for the runtime model generation
2. Support for the runtime simulation set-up
3. Support for complex runtime operating procedures
4. Interoperability with the third-party software
5. Suitability for embedding and use as a web application or software as a service
6. Code-generation, model exchange and co-simulation capabilities

News
====
[**June 29 2016**] The new 1.5.0 version is released. The most important new features:
    
-  The new c++/MPI code generator. It can generate the c++ source code that contains the exported simulation,
   data partitioning and interprocess communication using MPI. At the moment it is in the prrof of the concept stage.
-  Updated other code generators. FMI code generator tested using the available tests.
-  New types of plots in the DAE Plotter: animated 2D plot (including the video export), user-defined plots
   (through user-specified python source code) and plotting of user specified data.
-  Fixed bugs in calculation of initial conditions in daeSimulation.SolveInitial() and daeSimulation.Reinitialize() functions.
-  Added global dt, d, d2, dt_array, d_array and d2_array functions that calculate time/partial derivatives.
-  A number of small fixes and updates
