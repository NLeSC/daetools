/* What is the time? (AKA Hello world!) is a very simple model.
The model consists of a single variable ('time') and a single differential equation::

  d(time)/dt = 1

This way, the value of the variable 'time' is equal to the elapsed time in the simulation.

This tutorial presents the basic structure of daeModel and daeSimulation classes.
A typical DAETools simulation requires the following 8 tasks:
  1. Importing DAE Tools pyDAE module(s)
  2. Importing or declaration of units and variable types
     (unit and daeVariableType classes)
  3. Developing a model by deriving a class from the base daeModel class and:
     - Declaring domains, parameters and variables in the daeModel.__init__ function
     - Declaring equations and their residual expressions in the
       daeModel.DeclareEquations function
  4. Setting up a simulation by deriving a class from the base daeSimulation class and:
     - Specifying a model to be used in the simulation in the daeSimulation.__init__ function
     - Setting the values of parameters in the daeSimulation.SetUpParametersAndDomains function
     - Setting initial conditions in the daeSimulation.SetUpVariables function
  5. Declaring auxiliary objects required for the simulation
     - DAE solver object
     - Data reporter object
     - Log object
  6. Setting the run-time options for the simulation:
     - ReportingInterval
     - TimeHorizon
  7. Connecting a data reporter
  8. Initializing, running and finalizing the simulation */

     *      keeps only their references.

     *      Variable names can consists of letters, numbers, underscore ('_') and no other special characters (' ', '.', ',', '/', '-', etc).
     *      However, there is an exception. You can use the standards html code names, such as Greek characters: &alpha; &beta; &gamma; etc.
     *      Internally they will be used without '&' and ';' characters: alpha, beta, gamma, ...;
     *      but, in the equations exported in the MathML or Latex format they will be shown as native Greek letters.
     *      Also if you write the variable name as: Name_1 it will be transformed into Name with the subscript 1.
     *      In this example we use Greek character 'Ï„' to name the variable 'tau'. */

         *      In this example we simply write that the variable time derivative is equal to 1:
         *                              d(tau) / dt = 1
         *      which calculates the time as the current time elapsed in the simulation (which is a common way to obtain the current time within the model).
