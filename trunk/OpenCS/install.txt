Requirements
------------
 1. MPI (MSMPI on Windows)
 2. OpenMP
 3. OpenCL drivers/runtime libraries 
    Intel:  https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers
    AMD:    https://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/OpenCL2-Driver.aspx
    NVidia: https://developer.nvidia.com/opencl

GNU/Linux, macOS
----------------
Compile the third party libraries:
$ sh compile_opencs.sh libs

Compile OpenCS:
$ sh compile_opencs.sh opencs

Alternatively, OpenCS can be compiled using CMake GUI.


Windows
-------
Additional requirements:
1. bash environment. 
   Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win) has been successfully tested. 
   During installation, when asked select the following options:
    - Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt
    - Use Windowsâ€™ default console window
    - Add all bash commands to the PATH (note: it might 'hide' some Windows commands such as find): 
      i.e. C:\Program Files\Git\cmd;C:\Program Files\Git\mingw32\bin;C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin
2. wget is required for downloading the source archives. 
   If wget is missing it can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm. 
   The source archives of all libraries can also be downloaded manually to the OpenCS root directory.

Compile the third party libraries:
$ sh compile_opencs.sh libs

Compile OpenCS:
$ sh compile_opencs.sh opencs

Alternatively, OpenCS can be compiled using CMake GUI.

Known issues
------------
- macOS
  The binary OpenCS distribution is compiled using gcc 6.3 since the C++11 features are required.
  Therefore, it expects the following libraries (typically in /usr/local/lib):
    - libgcc_s.1.dylib
    - libgfortran.3.dylib
    - libgomp.1.dylib
    - libquadmath.0.dylib
    - libstdc++.6.dylib

- Windows
  Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable is required
